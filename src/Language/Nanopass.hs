-- | Nanopass consists essentially of creating languages and defining passes.
-- Languages can be created from scratch or by derivation using 'deflang'.
-- The tedious parts of a compiler pass (or at least, most passes) can be generated with 'defpass'.

-- More details and examples are given in the [readme](https://github.com/marseillebd/nanopass/blob/master/README.md).
